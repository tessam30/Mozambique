/* NOTES: The recall is only for 24 hours so not sure how reliable
		  the metric is. Will calculate but may be misleading. WDDS calculation
The categories are: 1. Starchy staples (WDDS_starch) 
                    2. Dark green leafy vegetables (WDDS_veg_green) 
                    3. Other Vitamin A rich fruit and veg (WDDS_vitA)
                    4. Other fruit and veg (WDDS_veg_other)
                    5. Organ meat (WDDS_organ)
                    6. Meat and fish (WDDS_meat_fish)
                    7. Eggs (WDDS_eggs)
                    8. Legumes, nuts, and seeds (WDDS_legumes)  
                    9. Milk and milk products (WDDS_dairy)

	http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136748
	The child DD score, which was the outcome variable in this analysis, 
	was created based on the mother’s recall of the child’s consumption 
	of food groups, 24 hours preceding the DHS interview of the mother. 
	The mother reported whether or not the child consumed the following 
	food groups/types: 
		1) Tinned, powdered or fresh milk; 
		2) Bread, rice, noodles, other made from grains; 
		3) Potatoes, cassava, or other tubers; 
		4) Eggs; 
		5) Meat (beef, pork, lamb, goat, chicken, etc.); 
		6) Pumpkin, carrots, squash (yellow or orange inside); 
		7) Any dark green leafy vegetables; 
		8) Vitamin A fruits; 
		9) other fruits containing vitamin A; 
		10) Liver, kidney, heart, other organs; 
		11) Fish or shellfish (fresh or dried); 
		12) Food made from beans, peas, lentils, nuts; 
		13) Cheese, yogurt, other milk products; 
		14) Oil, fats, butter, products made of them; 
		15) Chocolates, sweets, candies, pastries etc. 
	The response options were ‘yes, consumed’ (score 1) and 
	‘no, not consumed’ (score 0). These were summed up to create 
	the child DD score, which ranged from 0–15, and which was treated 
	in the analysis as a continuous variable.
